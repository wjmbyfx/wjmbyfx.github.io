The basic idea is using three pointers indicating 

1. the index where first class elements should be moved to
2. the index where third class elements should be moved to
3. the index of current elements being possessed

respectively, i, j, k

We set i=0, j=length-1, k=0;

We go through the string, 

- if element belongs to 1st class, we swap element at index of i and k, then we do i++, k++
- if element belongs to 3rd class, we swap element at index of j and k, then we do j--, k++
- if element belongs to 2nd class, we just do k++
- if k equals to j, we end the loop and it's the end of the algorithm.

This algorithm can be extended to sort more class, if we firstly view some class as one, and do it several times. More index indicator needed as well.
